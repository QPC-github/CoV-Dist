![CoV-Dist ](./img.svg)

## Overview
A python script to measure the dissimilarity distance between SARS-CoV-2 metagenome samples.

It will 
1) Calculate the Yue & Clayton dissimilarity index of two samples based on the base-pair proportions at each genomic position;
2) Sum all the dissimilarity indexes across the genome;
3) Output the sum as a distance metric;
4) Visualize the pairwise distance matrix among samples using PCoA, MDS or t-SNE method.

## Prerequisites
```
# set conda environment
conda create --name cov-dist python=3.8 biopython scikit-bio click pyvcf plotly=5.10.0 scipy==1.8.1

### dist input
* prefix_list: A prefix list file (a prefix per line). For each prefix, a `<prefix>.vcf` and a `<prefix>.depth` are supposed to be found. If a depth file is not provided, default to set all position depths are valid.
* ref: A reference fasta file which is used for the vcf files indicated in prefix_list.
* cov: A threshold for coverage to filter out disqualified vcf (and depth) files.
* depth: A depth threshold to include positions when calculating coverage.
* threads: Number of cpus used for computing in parallel.
* voc: A VOC (Variant Of Concern) folder path containing VOC vcf files, no depth files are needed. It can be used to investigate how close custom samples are to VOC lineages.
* out: Output folder name.

### plot input
* distance_file: The distance matrix resulting from "dist" command or any other distance matrix as long as its rownames and colnames are the same to the basename of the prefices and in the same order as the those in prefix file (e.g. if prefix is "a/b/c/xyz", the corresponding rowname and colname are "xyz").
* meta: A metadata file (tab-delimited) and it must has "sample", "collection_date" and "collection_site" columns.
* column: A column name in the meta data used to color samples in the pcoa plot. By default, "collection_date" and "collection_site" will be used to generate a special scatter plots. Otherwise, the program will use a provided column.
* analysis: Method to show samples. Can be choosen from PCoA (default), MDS, TSNE. Since case is not sensitive, uppercase and lowercase letters are both allowed.
* voc_meta: A metadata file for VOC (tab-delimited). It must has "sample" and "group" columns.
* out: Output folder name.

> metadata example:
```
sample  collection_site collection_date sample_group
2367    Arizona 2021-07-22      Batch1
2370    Arizona 2021-07-22      Batch1

4011    Arizona 2022-06-06      Batch10
4012    Arizona 2022-06-06      Batch10
4013    Arizona 2022-06-06      Batch10
...
```

> metadata for voc example:
```
sample  group
BA.1.14.2       Omicron
BA.5.7  Omicron
BF.21   Omicron
BA.5.6.1        Omicron
BA.1.14 Omicron
BA.1.6  Omicron
AY.107  Delta
AY.30   Delta
...
```

### Output summary
After running dist and plot, in the output directory, 4 files will be generated as listed below:
```
data/test/testout
├── distance.txt
├── <PCoA|MDS|TSNE>ordination_result.txt
├── <pcoa|mds|tsne>_plot_2d.html
└── <pcoa|mds|tsne>_plot_3d.html
```

* Calculated distance matrix: `distance.txt`. It could be used as input for other dimensionality reduction methods.
* Output from the PCoA, MDS or t-SNE: `<PCoA|MDS|TSNE>ordination_result.txt`. It could be used as input data for your preferred data visualization tool to plot the results.
* Plotly html (including both 3d and 2d scatter plots) with which user can interacte in the broswer and download a perferable snapshot as PNG: `<pcoa|mds|tsne>_plot_<3d|2d>.html`

## Notes
* If there is zero coverage for a position in the alignment, we assume the dissimilarity in that position is zero, which could lead to an underestimation of the distance between samples with low coverage.
* This method in theory could be measure dissimilarity between metagenomes and isolate genomes.
