Click [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ncbi/CoV-Dist/blob/main/pcoa_plot_3d.html) to play with the interactive PCoA plot CoV-dist generated.

## Overview
A python script to measure the dissimilarity distance between SARS-CoV-2 metagenome samples.

It will 
1) Calculate the Yue & Clayton dissimilarity index of two samples based on the base-pair proportions at each genomic position;
2) Sum all the dissimilarity indexes across the genome;
3) Output the sum as a distance metric;
4) Visualize the pairwise distance matrix among samples using PCoA, MDS or t-SNE method.

## Prerequisites
```

### dist input
* prefix_list: A prefix list file (a prefix per line). For each prefix, a `<prefix>.vcf` and a `<prefix>.depth` are supposed to be found. If a depth file is not provided, default to set all position depths are valid.
* ref: A reference fasta file which is used for the vcf files indicated in prefix_list.
* cov: A threshold for coverage to filter out disqualified vcf (and depth) files.
* depth: A depth threshold to include positions when calculating coverage.
* threads: Number of cpus used for computing in parallel.
* voc: A VOC (Variant Of Concern) folder path containing VOC vcf files, no depth files are needed. It can be used to investigate how close custom samples are to VOC lineages.
* outpath: Output file path.

Options:
  -d, --distance_file PATH        Distance file obtained from cov-dist "dist"

                                  collection_site are used to plot figures,
                                  but another column can also be provided.

### plot input
* distance_file: The distance matrix resulting from "dist" command or any other distance matrix as long as its rownames and colnames are the same to the basename of the prefices and in the same order as the those in prefix file (e.g. if prefix is "a/b/c/xyz", the corresponding rowname and colname are "xyz").
* meta: A metadata file (tab-delimited) and column names "sample", "collection_date" and "collection_site" is required.
* column: The column name in the meta data file that will be used to color samples in the pcoa plot. By default, "collection_date" and "collection_site" will be used to generate a special scatter plots. Otherwise, the program will use the specified column.
* analysis: Method to show samples. Can be choosen from PCoA (default), MDS, TSNE. Since case is not sensitive, uppercase and lowercase letters are both allowed.
* voc_meta: A metadata file for VOC (tab-delimited). It must have "sample" and "group" columns.
* out: Output folder name.

4012    Arizona 2022-06-06
4013    Arizona 2022-06-06

```

> metadata for voc example:
```
sample  group
BA.1.14.2       Omicron
BA.5.7  Omicron
BF.21   Omicron
BA.5.6.1        Omicron
BA.1.14 Omicron
BA.1.6  Omicron
AY.107  Delta
AY.30   Delta
...
```

### Output summary
After running dist and plot, a total of 4 files will be generated as listed below:
```
1. distance.txt
2. <PCoA|MDS|TSNE>_ordination_result.txt
3. <pcoa|mds|tsne>_plot_2d.html
4. <pcoa|mds|tsne>_plot_3d.html
```

* Calculated distance matrix: `distance.txt`. It could be used as input for other dimensionality reduction methods.
* Output from the PCoA, MDS or t-SNE: `<PCoA|MDS|TSNE>_ordination_result.txt`. It could be used as input data for your preferred data visualization tool to plot the results.
* Plotly html (including both 3d and 2d scatter plots) with which user can interacte in the broswer and download a perferable snapshot as PNG: `<pcoa|mds|tsne>_plot_<3d|2d>.html`

## Notes
* You can use [UShER](https://github.com/yatisht/usher) to retrive and update SARS-CoV-2 lineage information and convert that into `vcf` format
  ```
  wget http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/wuhCor1/UShER_SARS-CoV-2/public-latest.all.masked.pb.gz
  matUtils extract -i public-latest.all.masked.pb.gz -C lineagePaths.txt
  mkdir -p voc_vcf
  python ./usher_lineage2vcf.py lineagePaths.txt voc_vcf
  ```
* If there is zero coverage for a position in the alignment, we assume the dissimilarity in that position is zero, which could lead to an underestimation of the distance between samples with low coverage.
